# Stress-detection
Stress,anxiety and depression are threatening the mental health of the people these days. People often share their feelings on the social media platform in the form of instagram stories and posts.Many organizations can use stress detection to find which social media users are stressed to help them quickly.

Stress detection is a challenging task, as there are so many words that can be used by people on their posts that can show whether a person is having psychological stress or not. While looking for datasets that I can use to train a machine learning model for stress detection, I found a dataset on Kaggle with 116 columns.

The dataset I am using for this task contains data posted on subreddits related to mental health. This dataset contains various mental health problems shared by people about their life. Fortunately, this dataset is labelled as 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no stress and 1 indicates stress.
